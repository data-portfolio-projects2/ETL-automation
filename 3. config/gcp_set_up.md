## Setting up Google Cloud Functions with BigQuery

This guide outlines the steps to set up a Google Cloud Function (GCF) that processes data and uploads it to BigQuery.

**Step 1: Create a New Project in GCP**

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   Click on the project drop-down in the top menu bar.
    *   Select "New Project."
    *   Enter a name for your project and (optionally) an organization if applicable.
    *   Click "Create."

**Step 2: Enable Necessary APIs**

1.  **Navigate to APIs & Services > Library:**
    In the left-hand menu, click on "APIs & Services," then select "Library."

2.  **Enable Google Cloud Functions API:**
    *   Search for "Google Cloud Functions API."
    *   Click on it and then click "Enable."

3.  **Enable BigQuery API:**
    *   Search for "BigQuery API."
    *   Click on it and then click "Enable."

**Step 3: Create a Service Account**

1.  **Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts:**
    In the left-hand menu, click on "IAM & Admin," then select "Service accounts."

2.  **Create Service Account:**
    *   Click the "Create Service Account" button.
    *   Enter a name and ID for your service account.
    *   Click "Create and Continue."

3.  **Grant Permissions:**
    *   Add roles such as `BigQuery Data Editor` and `BigQuery Job User`.
    *   Click "Continue."

4.  **Create Key:**
    *   After creating the service account, open its details.
    *   Go to the "Keys" tab.
    *   Click "Add Key > Create New Key" and select JSON.
    *   Download the JSON key file and store it securely.

**Step 4: Deploy the Cloud Function**

1.  **Install the gcloud CLI:**
    Follow the instructions to install the `gcloud` CLI from the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2.  **Configure gcloud:**
    Open your terminal and set your project:
    ```bash
    gcloud config set project your-project-id
    ```
    *(Replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID)*

3.  **Deploy Your Cloud Function:**
    *   Navigate to the directory containing your `main.py` (your function code) and `requirements.txt` (list of dependencies) files.
    *   Deploy your Cloud Function using the following command:
        ```bash
        gcloud functions deploy process_data \
          --runtime python39 \
          --trigger-http \
          --allow-unauthenticated \
          --entry-point process_data \
          --set-env-vars GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account-file.json
        ```
        *   Replace `process_data` with your desired function name.
        *   Replace `python39` with the desired runtime (e.g., python310).
        *   Replace `/path/to/your/service-account-file.json` with the absolute path to your downloaded service account JSON key file.
        *   The `--allow-unauthenticated` flag makes the function publicly accessible (consider security implications and adjust as necessary for production).

**Summary:**

*   You create a project in GCP.
*   Enable the required APIs for Google Cloud Functions and BigQuery within that project.
*   Create a service account with appropriate permissions to interact with BigQuery.
*   Deploy your ETL script as a Cloud Function in this project.
*   The Cloud Function processes data and uploads it to BigQuery.

This setup allows you to leverage Cloud Functions for running your ETL script and BigQuery for storing the processed data, avoiding reliance on local resources.
