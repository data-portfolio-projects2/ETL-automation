# Uploading `kaggle.json` to Google Cloud Storage

This guide explains how to upload your `kaggle.json` API key file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This allows you to access Kaggle datasets and resources in your cloud-based projects without needing to store the key locally.

## Steps

1.  **Access Google Cloud Console:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Log in with your Google account if you haven’t already.

2.  **Navigate to Storage:**
    *   On the left sidebar of the Google Cloud Console, find and click on **"Storage"**. This will bring you to the Google Cloud Storage section, where you can manage your buckets and objects.
    *   Alternatively, you can search for **"Storage"** in the search bar at the top.

3.  **Find Your Bucket:**
    *   In the Cloud Storage section, you’ll see a list of your buckets. These are the containers where you store your files.
    *   Locate the bucket that you want to upload the `kaggle.json` file to. The bucket name will appear in the list.
    *   If you don’t have a bucket yet, you can create a new one by clicking on the **"Create bucket"** button.
    *   If you don’t know your bucket name, you can find it in the Google Cloud Console where you created it or by asking your cloud administrator if you're working within a shared project.

4.  **Grant Permissions (if necessary):**
    *   Make sure you have the necessary permissions to interact with the bucket. You should be an Owner, Editor, or have custom permissions that allow you to upload files.
    *   If you need to grant permissions to a service account or another user, go to the **IAM & Admin** section in the Google Cloud Console and set the appropriate roles for the account.

5.  **Using `gsutil` to Interact with Your Bucket:**
    Now that you know your bucket name, you can interact with it using the Google Cloud SDK and the `gsutil` command.

    Here’s how to access and upload files to your bucket using the `gsutil` command:

    *   **Authenticate with Google Cloud SDK (if you haven’t already):**
        ```bash
        gcloud auth login
        ```
    *   **Set Your Project (if you haven’t already):**
        Make sure you're working within the correct Google Cloud project where your bucket is located:
        ```bash
        gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        ```
    *   **Upload `kaggle.json` to Your Bucket:**
        Now you can upload your `kaggle.json` file to your storage bucket. Replace `your-bucket-name` with the actual name of your bucket:
        ```bash
        gsutil cp kaggle.json gs://your-bucket-name/
        ```
        Example: If your bucket name is `my-kaggle-bucket`, the command will be:
        ```bash
        gsutil cp kaggle.json gs://my-kaggle-bucket/
        ```
    *   **Verify Upload:**
        After uploading, you can verify the file is in your bucket by navigating to the **Google Cloud Console > Storage > Browser** section. Your file should be listed under the bucket you uploaded it to.

Now your `kaggle.json` file is stored in Google Cloud Storage, and you can reference it in your scripts without downloading it locally.
