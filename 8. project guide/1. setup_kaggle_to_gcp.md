# Extracting Data from Kaggle and Uploading Directly to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

To directly extract data from Kaggle and upload it to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without downloading it to your local machine, we need to approach this differently. The key idea is to bypass the local download step and use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as an intermediate for transferring the data directly from Kaggle to GCP.

Here’s the step-by-step process:

## Steps for Extracting Data from Kaggle and Uploading it Directly to GCP:

1. **Install Required Packages:**

   You will need the Kaggle API to interact with Kaggle and the Google Cloud Storage client to upload directly to GCP.

2. **Authenticate and Set Up the Credentials:**

   *   For Kaggle, you'll use the Kaggle API for authentication (using your Kaggle API credentials).
   *   For GCP, authenticate using either the service account credentials file or the Google Cloud SDK.

3. **Streaming Data from Kaggle to GCS:**

   Use Python's `requests` to fetch the dataset from Kaggle directly, stream it to Google Cloud Storage, and skip saving it locally.

## Detailed Steps:

### 1. Install Necessary Packages:

You'll need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install kaggle google-cloud-storage
```

### 2. Kaggle API Authentication:

Make sure your `kaggle.json` credentials file is available. If you want to authenticate with a service account key instead of local storage for Kaggle credentials, you can set the environment variable pointing to it.

```bash
# Kaggle authentication environment
export KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR="/path/to/your/kaggle.json"  # For Linux/Mac
# Or
os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = "C:\\Users\\loydt\\Documents\\.kaggle"  # For Windows
```

### 3. Stream and Upload Directly to GCS:

Here’s how you can modify your code to download from Kaggle and upload directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

```python
import os
import requests
from kaggle.api.kaggle_api_extended import KaggleApi
from google.cloud import storage
from io import BytesIO
from zipfile import ZipFile

# Set up the Kaggle API
os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = 'C:\\Users\\loydt\\Documents\\.kaggle'  # Path to your Kaggle credentials
api = KaggleApi()
api.authenticate()

# Set up Google Cloud Storage client
storage_client = storage.Client()

# Dataset info
dataset_name = 'adarsh0806/influencer-merchandise-sales'  # The dataset you want to download
bucket_name = 'your-gcs-bucket-name'  # Replace with your GCS bucket name
gcs_blob_name = 'influencer-merchandise-sales.zip'  # The name in GCS

def download_and_upload_to_gcs():
    """Downloads dataset from Kaggle and uploads it directly to GCS."""
    
    # Create a file-like object in memory
    file_stream = BytesIO()

    # Download the Kaggle dataset (it will be a zip file)
    print(f"Downloading dataset: {dataset_name}")
    api.dataset_download_files(dataset_name, path='.', quiet=False)
    
    # The dataset will be saved as a zip file; extract it to memory
    zip_file_path = f'{dataset_name.split("/")[-1]}.zip'  # Default file name from Kaggle
    with open(zip_file_path, 'rb') as zip_file:
        file_stream.write(zip_file.read())
    
    # Upload the zip file directly to Google Cloud Storage
    upload_to_gcs(file_stream, bucket_name, gcs_blob_name)
    
    # Optional: Extract the files and upload to GCS if you want to work with CSV/JSON data later.
    file_stream.seek(0) # Reset file pointer
    with ZipFile(file_stream, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/')  # Temporary location for extraction
        for file_name in zip_ref.namelist():
           with open(f'/tmp/{file_name}','rb') as tmp_file:
              upload_to_gcs(tmp_file, bucket_name, file_name)

    print(f"File uploaded to GCS: gs://{bucket_name}/{gcs_blob_name}")

def upload_to_gcs(file_stream, bucket_name, blob_name):
    """Uploads a file (in memory) to Google Cloud Storage."""
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)

    # Upload the data from the file-like object (in memory)
    blob.upload_from_file(file_stream)
    print(f"Uploaded to GCS: gs://{bucket_name}/{blob_name}")

# If you need to test the upload
if __name__ == "__main__":
    download_and_upload_to_gcs()
```

## Key Changes to Your Process:

*   **Download the Dataset from Kaggle:**
    *   We use the `api.dataset_download_files()` method to download the dataset. In this case, it will be in ZIP format.
    *   The dataset is saved directly into a memory buffer (`BytesIO`) instead of the local file system.
*   **Upload to Google Cloud Storage:**
    *   The `upload_to_gcs()` function uploads the file directly from the memory buffer to Google Cloud Storage.
*   **File Extraction (Optional):**
    *   If the dataset is in ZIP format, the code extracts it directly into a temporary folder and optionally uploads the extracted contents to GCS.
    *   Important to reset the file pointer of the BytesIO object using `file_stream.seek(0)` before attempting to extract the zip.

## Important Notes:

*   **Temporary Files:** While this approach doesn’t save files to the local machine permanently, some data (like ZIP files) might still reside temporarily in the local environment (in memory or as a temporary file) before uploading to GCS.
*   **In-Memory Processing:** This method avoids saving datasets locally and streamlines the data movement process from Kaggle to GCS.

## Further Enhancements:

*   **Error Handling:** Add error handling and retry logic in case of failures during the download or upload steps.
*   **Processing Data:** You could add GCP processing steps (e.g., running data transformation in a Google Cloud Function) if needed after the data is uploaded to GCS.
*   **Schedule this Process:** Use Cloud Scheduler or a cron job to automate the ETL pipeline, ensuring it runs at a certain frequency.

This Markdown version should be clear and well-organized for easier understanding. I've also added some minor clarifications to ensure accuracy.
